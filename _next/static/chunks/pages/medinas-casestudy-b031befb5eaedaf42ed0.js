Regardless of engineering team size, our e2e tests (powered by TestCafe) now reduce the number of defects shipped, and are able to run in the background almost immediately after a pull request is created. It also creates a contract around the intent of what was developed in the platform. For example, if we make a decision about how a feature works, and that feature isn\u2019t updated or touched for 6 months, we\u2019ll often forget the context and nuance behind how it works (regardless of how much documentation we create around the feature). It\u2019s very easy to make a change without realizing the impact of prior-made decisions. Our testing layer helps prevent us from breaking those features. One of the best ways to prove a product is worth the time is based on how quickly you can see it working in your own project. Take 60 minutes, install it, aim it at your web project, and have it click around and run an assertion.
