The library includes everything you need to create tests, run them, and review test results. Our premium products simplify the TestCafe workflow for teams and non-programmers.</p>\r\n<p>TestCafe Studio is a desktop application that speeds up the test creation process. Record test scripts in the browser or use action templates to build your test suite without writing a single line of code.</p>\r\n<p>TestCafe Dashboard is a web-based test report aggregator that tackles debugging and test suite scaling issues. Run tests with the open-source framework and feed test reports to Dashboard. The user-friendly web UI helps your team review test results, access screenshots and videos, and detect unstable tests.</p>\r\n","<p>Every test report a member of your organization uploads to Dashboard counts toward the “test run” limit. If you execute a test suite with 100 tests, TestCafe removes 100 “test runs” from your quota.</p>\r\n<p>The test run limit does not restrict your ability to use the open-source TestCafe test runner. TestCafe only limits the number of test results you can upload to Dashboard. Select a different test reporter if you don’t want to upload test run data to Dashboard.</p>\r\n","<p>Users that reach the test run limit receive a notification. Upgrade your plan to increase the test run limit. Team subscribers can contact us at info@testcafe.io to discuss limit extension options.</p>\r\n","<p>If your organization reaches the user limit, you lose the ability to invite more users. You can remove an existing user from your organization to free up a user slot. Upgrade your subscription to extend the user limit. If multiple teams in your organization use TestCafe Dashboard, consider purchasing a separate subscription for each of the teams. If you still want to extend your quotas beyond the limits of the Team tier, contact us at info@testcafe.io to get a quote.</p>\r\n"]},"__N_SSG":true}
