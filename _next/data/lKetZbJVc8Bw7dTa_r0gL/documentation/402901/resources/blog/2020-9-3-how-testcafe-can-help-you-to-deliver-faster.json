Unit tests allow developers to verify whether “small” portions of a solution work as intended, but do so <strong>independent of the whole</strong>. While it may be tempting to use green unit tests as the prime delivery condition within a CI/CD system, unit tests will always remain granular and limited in scope.</p>\r\n<p>Unit tests allow developers to flag problematic code modifications, but unit tests cannot accurately determine whether all parts of a given system are working <strong>together flawlessly</strong>.  Said differently, unit tests cannot establish whether all usage scenarios are fully tested and meet an organization’s quality standards.</p>\r\n<p>By contrast, end-to-end tests can check/analyze whether the entire system operates as expected (the whole and not just its parts). End-to-end tests can emulate user actions and determine whether real output matches expected outcomes. Unit tests are important, but we believe that only end-to-end test automation can deliver the reliability users have come to expect from today’s top software organizations.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"testcafe--end-to-end-testing-made-easy__$\"><a class=\"anchor-fix\" href=\"#testcafe--end-to-end-testing-made-easy\" id=\"testcafe--end-to-end-testing-made-easy\"></a>TestCafe – End-to-End Testing Made Easy<a class=\"anchor-hash\" href=\"#testcafe--end-to-end-testing-made-easy\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" fill=\"none\"><path d=\"M12.586 2.586a2 2 0 112.828 2.828l-3 3a2 2 0 01-2.828 0 1 1 0 00-1.414 1.414 4 4 0 005.656 0l3-3a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.5 1.5a1 1 0 101.414 1.414l1.5-1.5zm-5 5a2 2 0 012.828 0 1 1 0 101.414-1.414 4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-3 3a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.5-1.5a1 1 0 10-1.414-1.414l-1.5 1.5a2.002 2.002 0 01-3.438-1.407 2 2 0 01.61-1.42l3-3z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></a></h2>\r\n<p>TestCafe is an enterprise-ready end-to-end testing framework with an intuitive API. Unlike legacy frameworks such as Selenium, TestCafe is easy to install, run, and integrate within an organization’s CI/CD pipeline. You can install the framework via npm with a single command. Since TestCafe does not require tedious configuration or plugins, it can be wound up in a new CI system within minutes. And yes, with TestCafe, you do not need to locate, install, and configure additional testing software/modules. TestCafe is self-contained and only requires Node.js and your preferred browser (no browser plugins are needed).</p>\r\n<p>In addition, TestCafe allows you to test next-gen web features with absolute ease. TestCafe supports all major modern browsers (either locally or cloud-based) – across a variety of mobile or desktop devices. TestCafe can execute its tests on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. You can use Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge and Internet Explorer when and where appropriate – you can even use headless browsers (a great way to decrease testing time and to execute browser tests on VMs with no graphical system).</p>\r\n<p>As you’ll see below, we’ve taken care of everything under the hood so you and your team can avoid configuration hassles and the steep learning curve associated with legacy testing frameworks.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"how-to-integrate-testcafe-in-your-cicd__$\"><a class=\"anchor-fix\" href=\"#how-to-integrate-testcafe-in-your-cicd\" id=\"how-to-integrate-testcafe-in-your-cicd\"></a>How to Integrate TestCafe in Your CI/CD<a class=\"anchor-hash\" href=\"#how-to-integrate-testcafe-in-your-cicd\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" fill=\"none\"><path d=\"M12.586 2.586a2 2 0 112.828 2.828l-3 3a2 2 0 01-2.828 0 1 1 0 00-1.414 1.414 4 4 0 005.656 0l3-3a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.5 1.5a1 1 0 101.414 1.414l1.5-1.5zm-5 5a2 2 0 012.828 0 1 1 0 101.414-1.414 4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-3 3a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.5-1.5a1 1 0 10-1.414-1.414l-1.5 1.5a2.002 2.002 0 01-3.438-1.407 2 2 0 01.61-1.42l3-3z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></a></h2>\r\n<p>TestCafe can be incorporated into a pipeline with a few simple steps:  </p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Install Node.js</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Install TestCafe</strong>. As mentioned earlier, TestCafe can be installed with a simple command: <code>npm install -g testcafe</code>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Run TestCafe tests</strong>. Only a single command is required to execute a test (for instance: <code>testcafe chrome:headless ./tests</code>). With this simple command, TestCafe will auto detect the browser (if installed), launch it, and run your tests automatically.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>TestCafe ships with five reporters – modules that can generate test execution reports for your CI/CD. JSON, JUnit, xUnit, and console output (with rich formatting) are built-in.
