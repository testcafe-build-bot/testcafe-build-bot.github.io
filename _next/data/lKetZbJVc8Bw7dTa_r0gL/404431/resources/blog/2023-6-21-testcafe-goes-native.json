Back then, no tool on the market satisfied our needs, so we had to figure out our own way to implement cross-browser automation.</p>\r\n<p>The TestCafe team solved this problem with <a href=\"https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe-hammerhead\" target=\"_blank\">testcafe-hammerhead<span class=\"svg-no-wrap\">&#65279;<svg fill=\"none\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"currentColor\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M10 6H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v10a2 2 0 002 2h10a2 2 0 002-2v-4M14 4h6m0 0v6m0-6L10 14\"></path></svg></span></a> — a URL-rewriting proxy. Hammerhead intercepts HTTP requests, and injects automation scripts into test pages. That way, TestCafe can control what happens in the browser. But the proxy solution has its faults.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>The <strong>URL rewriting submodule</strong> of the proxy is complex and requires a lot of maintainance. It has to identify, intercept, and modify every HTTP request. Request handling errors can lead to application malfunction, and unexpected test failure.</p>\r\n<p>  Even if the URL rewriter works perfectly, it still slows down the framework. To keep this overhead to a minimum, the TestCafe team needs to expend considerable effort to optimize the submodule.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>The <strong>event emulation</strong> submodule is no less complex. To emulate user behavior the same way in every browser, it needs to account for each browser’s unique characteristics. Browser updates often upset this balance, and introduce event emulation issues.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The TestCafe proxy as a whole needs to account for a large amount of edge cases. It needs multiple safeguards to make sure that TestCafe does not interfere with your application. Due to these factors, the TestCafe proxy has been growing in size and complexity. And the bigger it gets, the harder it is to maintain.</p>\r\n<p>The TestCafe team has long wanted to replace the proxy with a better tool. That’s where the CDP protocol comes in.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-native-automation__$\"><a class=\"anchor-fix\" href=\"#benefits-of-native-automation\" id=\"benefits-of-native-automation\"></a>Benefits of Native Automation<a class=\"anchor-hash\" href=\"#benefits-of-native-automation\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" fill=\"none\"><path d=\"M12.586 2.586a2 2 0 112.828 2.828l-3 3a2 2 0 01-2.828 0 1 1 0 00-1.414 1.414 4 4 0 005.656 0l3-3a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.5 1.5a1 1 0 101.414 1.414l1.5-1.5zm-5 5a2 2 0 012.828 0 1 1 0 101.414-1.414 4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-3 3a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.5-1.5a1 1 0 10-1.414-1.414l-1.5 1.5a2.002 2.002 0 01-3.438-1.407 2 2 0 01.61-1.42l3-3z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></a></h2>\r\n<p>Native Automation solves many of the issues that the TestCafe proxy created.</p>\r\n<p>When TestCafe uses the native CDP protocol, the framework doesn’t need to rewrite URLs and disrupt the logic of the user application. If TestCafe needs to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"/documentation/402842/guides/intermediate-guides/intercept-http-requests\">mock HTTP responses</a> or perform HTTP authentication, it can use the <strong>native</strong> <a href=\"https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Fetch/#event-requestPaused\" target=\"_blank\">requestPaused hook<span class=\"svg-no-wrap\">&#65279;<svg fill=\"none\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"currentColor\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M10 6H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v10a2 2 0 002 2h10a2 2 0 002-2v-4M14 4h6m0 0v6m0-6L10 14\"></path></svg></span></a>. The browser can handle most other tasks on its own.</p>\r\n<p>The CDP protocol allows TestCafe to natively execute common browser actions (<code>click</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>pressKey</code>). As a result, these actions are more stable and easier to troubleshoot.</p>\r\n<p>The move to CDP allowed the TestCafe team to remove a lot of complex code that caused trouble. This, in turn, increased the framework’s stability and ease of debugging.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps, most importantly, CDP automation increases test speed. To illustrate this point, we benchmarked the TestCafe test suite of the <a href=\"https://demos.devexpress.com/aspxgridviewdemos/\" target=\"_blank\">DevExpress ASP.NET Grid Components<span class=\"svg-no-wrap\">&#65279;<svg fill=\"none\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"currentColor\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M10 6H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v10a2 2 0 002 2h10a2 2 0 002-2v-4M14 4h6m0 0v6m0-6L10 14\"></path></svg></span></a> team.</p>\r\n<p>Each of the 98 tests ran a total of eight times — four times with Native Automation, and four times with the legacy TestCafe proxy. We calculated the average test runtime for each run configuration, and compared the two.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/images/native-automation-comparison-bar-chart.png\" alt=\"Test runtime comparison\"></p>\r\n<p>The average test run duration <em>with Native Automation</em> was 6 minutes 28 seconds. The average <em>proxy</em> test run lasted <strong>17 minutes 50 seconds</strong>, a whole <strong>275% longer</strong>. Individual tests were up to <strong>85% faster</strong> with Native Automation.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/images/native-automation-speed-increase.png\" alt=\"Test runtime comparison\"></p>\r\n<p>Multiple tests that ran well with Native Automation yielded errors with the proxy. Three tests failed on one occasion, and one test failed 3 out of 4 times.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"challenges-to-overcome__$\"><a class=\"anchor-fix\" href=\"#challenges-to-overcome\" id=\"challenges-to-overcome\"></a>Challenges to overcome<a class=\"anchor-hash\" href=\"#challenges-to-overcome\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" fill=\"none\"><path d=\"M12.586 2.586a2 2 0 112.828 2.828l-3 3a2 2 0 01-2.828 0 1 1 0 00-1.414 1.414 4 4 0 005.656 0l3-3a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.5 1.5a1 1 0 101.414 1.414l1.5-1.5zm-5 5a2 2 0 012.828 0 1 1 0 101.414-1.414 4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-3 3a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.5-1.5a1 1 0 10-1.414-1.414l-1.5 1.5a2.002 2.002 0 01-3.438-1.407 2 2 0 01.61-1.42l3-3z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></a></h2>\r\n<p>Native automation is great, but not all-powerful. TestCafe includes a wide variety of capabilities, some of which just don’t work with CDP. Most of these limitations are minor, and won’t cause much discomfort. For example:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The CDP protocol only works in local Chromium-based browsers. If your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"/documentation/402639/reference/command-line-interface#browsers\">browser selection</a> includes other browsers, such as Firefox or Safari, TestCafe runs your tests with the Hammerhead proxy. To take advantage of Native Automation <em>and</em> run tests in other browsers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"/documentation/404237/guides/intermediate-guides/native-automation-mode\">create two separate test runs</a>.</li>\r\n<li>TestCafe cannot run tests in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"/documentation/402841/guides/intermediate-guides/multiple-browser-windows\">multiple browser windows</a>. </li>\r\n<li>You cannot set a custom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"/documentation/402638/reference/configuration-file#pagerequesttimeout\">page request timeout</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"/documentation/402638/reference/configuration-file#ajaxrequesttimeout\">AJAX request timeout</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>As the framework’s development continues, the TestCafe team hopes to resolve these issues.
